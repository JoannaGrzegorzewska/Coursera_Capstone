Data about the size of population in Toronto downloaded from
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/  "neighbourhood-profiles-2016-csv".
Toronto city geographical coordinates data will be utilized as input for the Foursquare API. 
I will use the Foursquare API to explore already existing restaurants in neighbourhoods 
in Toronto and combine it with size of population data. I will use the visualization on choropleth maps.
